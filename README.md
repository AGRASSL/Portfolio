Alex Grassl Portfolio Assignment

# Description
This portfolio is the starting layout for my professional portfolio in Northwestern's Full Flex Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment is to utilize the knowledge of advanced CSS and HTML to create an environment where we can display our work on our own platform. Creating a portfolio has given me the opportunity to put my own touch to the work that we have started doing in the course.

This portfolio with be constantly evolving and improving throughout the duration of the course and my career.
